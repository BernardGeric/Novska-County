            <h2>History of Novska</h2>
            <p>The beginnings of the history of construction and life in built dwellings are connected with today's Stari Selo, the northeastern part of the city. In the List of parishes of the Zagreb archdiocese in 1334, the parish Item sancti Demetrii de Belina is also mentioned - which is associated with "Bjelavina". This is the oldest name for Novska.

                Church of St. Demetrius was built in the place where today the Church of St. Luke the Evangelist, is also mentioned in the canonical visitation of 1489 - along with the mention of its pastor Andrija. It was mentioned for the last time during the canonical visitation in 1501.
                
                The area of ​​Novska was the property of Countess Katarina Svetačka, until the invasion of the Turks (starting in 1530), and then Christopher II. Svetački became a Turkish vassal in 1540. Seeing that he could not keep his possessions, he handed over his four fortresses to the sultan, including Novska, then Wyvar (Ujvar or Novigrad), which was built by the Svetački in 1532 as a defense against the Turks - that it existed was also witnessed by Luka Ilić from Oriov in "Antiquities": "...That fortified town was located on Orlovo polje..." - south of today's Radnička street (even today the old residents of Novlja mention "Orešič-grad". The Novlja region was the property of the Saints for 450 years the first time in 1231. During the Turkish campaign and the fall of the most famous fort in this area - Kraljeve Velika - in 1544. At that time, the Church of St. Demetrius was destroyed.
                
                Friar Luka Ibrišimović liberated all of Slavonia, including Novska, in 1685. It can be said that then the gloomy and difficult medieval period for Novska and its surroundings ends and modern development begins.
                
                For the history of Slavonia, as well as Novska and the settlements that gravitate to it, the chamber censuses in Slavonia in 1698, which are preserved in the Vienna archives, are precious testimonies and indispensable sources of inestimable value. According to that list, there were thirteen villages and hamlets in the district of Kraljeva Velika: Kraljeva Velika, Lipovljani, Kričke, Gornji and Donji Rajić, Roždanik, Jazavica, Vočarica, Novska, Stara Subocka, Borovac, Bodegraj and Lađevac. At that time (1698), the Novlja area received its first administrative division - it also fell under the district of Kraljeva Velika. As the number of settlements increased, so did the number of inhabitants. In the Record of the canonical visitation of Jazavička parish, held in 1746, it is written for Novska that there are 50 houses, 300 capable of confession (adults) and 36 children - a total of 336 Novlja parishioners.
                
                In 1755, a chapel was built in Brestača and dedicated to St. Katarini (the oldest church in the Novlja area, built of wood).
                
                Parish of St. Luke Evangelista was founded in 1789. Novlja's history, based on preserved parish archives, was written in 1872 by the then Novlja parish priest Luka Ilić from Oriov, writer, ethnographer, historian and numismatist.
                
                The urban structure of Novska was given an outline in the 18th century, first of all by the settlement of Krajiška cesta, which was built by Empress Maria Theresa, then by the construction of residential buildings on both sides of the Novljančica stream. The triangle consists of three main (oldest) streets. In the 19th and 20th centuries, development changed and completed the urban core and settlements.
                
                With the construction of the railway from Sunja in the direction of Novska and Nova Gradiška in 1888, as well as the Novska - Dugo Selo railway in 1897, Novska became an important railway hub.
                
                Novska was hit by a tornado on May 31, 1892. It was the first recorded tornado in the history of Croatia.[5]
                
                In the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, divided into nine districts, the district of Novska occupied an area of ​​618 km2 in 1931 with 29,164 inhabitants.
                
                Church of St. Luke and the parish house from 1773 (it was demolished in 1902 and a new one was built the same year) are baroque buildings from the 18th century. Art Nouveau buildings in the 19th century: The old hotel, the former pharmacy and other non-existent buildings architecturally gave Novska its urban meaning. This tradition continued for ten years after the Second World War.
                
                One of the buildings that has withstood the test of time and urban plans is the HPT building and the "Forestry" building.
                
                The inconsistency of urban plans and weak economic trends, as well as the inexperience of staff supported by an insufficient sense of belonging to the city, devastated Novska.
                
                In the seventies of the 19th century, all cultural and social life took place around the "Reading Society in Novska", whose initiator and founder was Luka Ilić of Oriovčan, and around the Zagreb branches of other similar associations. This continuity was preserved even in the first decades of the 20th century by the activities of the "Croatian Falcon", "Šubić", "Graničar", the Voluntary Fire Brigade... A good part of the cultural activities also took place during the Second World War, and after it with a different sign. Even in that time, Croatian national consciousness, religion, culture and folk customs were preserved.
                
                During the Homeland War, Novska was a city under immediate threat. There was a danger that it would be occupied by Greater Serbian forces, given the relative proximity of the rebel areas and parts of BiH to us.</p>
